# rock-paper-scissors
This is the first project I have ever created using HTML/CSS/JS.

I used basic techniques to create a rudimentary web game of rock, paper, scissors. I also used simple techniques to create a basic UI for the game.

I limited my cleanup of my code, as I wanted this project to serve as a snapshot reference for my future self to see how far I have (hopefully) progressed.
